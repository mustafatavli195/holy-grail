# Holy Grail Layout

This project demonstrates a classic "Holy Grail" layout using HTML and CSS. The Holy Grail layout is a layout pattern that consists of a header, footer, and three columns (left sidebar, main content area, right sidebar). This layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox.

## Features

- Responsive design with media queries for different screen sizes.
- Flexbox for layout management.
- Clean and simple structure with minimal CSS.

## Project Structure

Here is a brief overview of the structure:

- **header**: The top section of the layout.
- **.main**: A container for the main content and sidebars.
  - **.left**: The left sidebar.
  - **main**: The main content area.
  - **.right**: The right sidebar.
- **footer**: The bottom section of the layout.

## CSS Breakdown

- **Global Styles**:
  - `*`: Margin and padding are reset, box-sizing is set to border-box.
  - `body`: Sets the height, background color, font properties, and flexbox settings.

- **Header, Footer, Main Content, and Sidebars**:
  - Each section (header, footer, left, right, and main) has a unique background color and padding.

- **Media Query**:
  - Adjusts the layout to stack columns vertically on screens smaller than 550px.

## Purpose

I created this project to refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS and to gain practice in responsive design.
